## About This Site

The inspiration for this site comes largely from the desire to have a curated collection of the critical movers and shakers in the Notes/Domino community.   This encompasses people, companies, and products.

The people who put their precious time and energy into the blogs, forums, companies, books, products, and open source solutions can help you solve any problem you have.  These are the genius inventors in the ecosystem.

Some people have been left out who should be referenced in this site.  This is inevitable given that:
* we do not know everyone in the industry
* we can only read English

We need your help to improve the content of this site, to add the missing people and content!

## Contribute Content

No coding is necessary -- just a basic understanding of:
* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  Specifically, this variation of it: [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)
* Because column alignment is important in Markdown, a good editor such as [CotEditor for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coteditor/id1024640650?mt=12) -- though really any Courier font editor will do, including [NotePad++ for Windows](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
* [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to edit your 'forked' version of the site and then issue a 'pull request' for us to merge in your changes.
* [Documentation theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).  This was chosen to enable version control / change tracking and low editing overhead, while also offering a responsive design.

When making pull requests, we ask that you only add information, not remove anything currently.  You can also use the comment system below (Disqus) if you wish to make content suggestions without going through GitHub.
